# Kotlin_BeginnerFriendly_Dump_hacktober2023   
You know the drill. A beginner friendly repo built while keeping the spirit of Hacktoberfest in mind; this year's topic: Kotlin.
<br><br>

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR BEGINNERS:**  <br><br>
Goto the "Basics" folder and then send in a pull request. 
Examples include: The 4 basic arithmetic ops (a full-blown code for basic arithmetic calclator will also be considered as a basic folder contri); basic I/O ops and the like.

<br>

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXPERIENCED DEVS:**   <br>
Goto the "Advanced" folder and then send in a pull request.
Examples include: Sorting and Generator ops, heavy data manipulation code and the like.

<br>

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR STANDALONE APP DEVS:** <br>
If you have an entire app that you would like to patch in to this project, then please feel free to create your own subfolder in the "Standalone" folder.

<br>

**INSTRUCTIONS IF CONFUSED:** <br>
If your code doesn't seem to fit in either of these folders, then please feel free to send in your PR to the "Misc" folder; I will review each one individually and if they seem to fit in either of the existing folders, you will be notified to send in your PR to a specific folder, (basically help you decide via a rejected PR submission.)<br>
Else if your code is truly _extraordinary_, it will become a part of the "Misc" folder right off the bat.


<br>

**THIS YEAR'S TOPIC DOESN'T MATCH YOUR INTEREST?** <br>
Feel free to browse through my profile and find an existing repo that you think you can contribute to; every hacktoberfest, I make a repo for a specific topic and even name them with the Hacktoberfest string explicitly for faster identification. The entire point of me doing this is to encourage and welcome as many devs as I can to the world of open source, no matter their skill level. 
https://github.com/taanngent and I run and will continue to run repos like this one every single hacktoberfest for as long as possible. \
Let's keep the spirit of hacktoberfest alive, a contribution that is made in good faith is all that matters, big or small is an invalid question.

<br>

**NON TECH BACKGROUND OR WANT TO CONTRIBUTE BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE?** <br>
Welcome to Open Source; if this is your first time on Github, rest assured that you can contribute in more ways than one. Feel free to add your designs, stories or even fun trivia related to computers/machines in general in the "NonCodeLounge" folder, in the form of whatever file format you wish. If you are completely new, I would recommend creating a .txt file and writing down whatever your heart desires. For example, it can be how you came across github or hacktoberfest in general or just straight up write down appreciation texts for programmers and developers in your life. Trust me, every little sentence goes a long way. <3
